Disco-nnect Four

A version of connect four the world didn't need but got anyway!

Technologies Used:

HTML5
CSS3
jQuery
Velocity UI Min JS


Steps:

I began wireframing before pseudo coding so that I had a visual idea of what MVP would look like. I ran into many issues while attempting to recreate this game and watched many tutorials that honestly only confused me even more in terms of attempting the win logic.

I referenced the tic tac toe assignment solution many times but found it difficult to implement it to my own version using prototypes and switch statements.

MVP

1-Create a grid where you click the top of a column and the chip goes to the bottom.

2-Use switch player functionality

3-Win functionality

4-Event listener for winning player.

Struggles:

1- Win game logic was an issue.
